Hi! I'm a PhD student working on networking systems. Welcome to my hub!

:computer: Projects I'm working on:

- Systems and networking for GPU disaggregation

:hammer_and_wrench: Systems I've built:

- RoUD: a case for building a general and high-performance RDMA service over UD in datacenter networks. To be published.
- MasQ: an efficient method to expose RDMA in the public (multi-tenant) cloud. Details can refer to our [SIGCOMM paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3387514.3405849). This work was done during my internship at the computer networks lab of Huawei.
